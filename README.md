<h2>Description</h2>
This is a walk-through of a group project I worked on during my ALX Professional Foundations course. We picked the Healthcare sector from the GCGO challenges and in finding a particular problem we would like to solve, we chose Data Security -to give it a broad name. And we came up with satisfactory solutions.
